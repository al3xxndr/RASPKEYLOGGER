START HERE:

1. Set up your Raspberry Pi: Install the operating system (such as Raspbian) on your Raspberry Pi and ensure it is connected to the internet.

2. Choose a programming language: Select a programming language such as Python to write your keylogger. Python provides libraries that make it relatively straightforward to capture keystrokes.

3. Implement keylogging functionality: Write a script that captures keystrokes and saves them to a log file. There are Python libraries available, like `pynput`, that can assist with capturing keyboard events.

4. Run the keylogger on your Raspberry Pi: Execute the keylogger script on your Raspberry Pi to start capturing keystrokes. Make sure it runs in the background, so it remains undetectable.

5. Remote access via Termius: Install the Termius app on your iPhone and set up SSH access to your Raspberry Pi. This will allow you to remotely access and control your Raspberry Pi.

6. Monitor and retrieve logs: Use Termius or any SSH client to connect to your Raspberry Pi remotely. Navigate to the directory where the keylogger is saving logs and retrieve the captured keystrokes.


PYNPUT:

If you're interested in capturing keystrokes in Python, one popular library you can consider is called "pynput." The pynput library provides functionality for controlling and monitoring input devices such as keyboards and mice. With pynput, you can capture keystrokes and perform various actions based on the input.

You can install the pynput library using pip, the Python package installer, by running the following command:

```
pip install pynput
```

Once installed, you can import the `keyboard` module from pynput to capture keystrokes. Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to use pynput to capture and print keystrokes:




SCRIPT EXPLANATION:

The script begins by importing the necessary module `keyboard` from the `pynput` package. This module provides functionality for capturing keyboard events. 

Next, the script sets the name of the log file as `'keystrokes.log'` and initializes an empty string variable called `current_sentence`, which will be used to store the captured keystrokes.

The script defines a function `on_press` that is called when a key is pressed. Inside this function, it tries to extract the character representation of the pressed key using `key.char`. If the pressed key corresponds to a printable character, it appends the character to the `current_sentence` string. If the pressed key is a special key like the spacebar or the enter key, it appends the corresponding characters to the `current_sentence` string.

The script also defines a function `on_release` that is called when a key is released. Inside this function, it checks if the released key is the escape key. If it is, the function returns `False`, which will stop the listener and exit the script. Otherwise, it opens the log file in append mode and writes the content of the `current_sentence` string to the file. After writing, it resets the `current_sentence` to an empty string.

Next, the script creates a listener object by passing the `on_press` and `on_release` functions as parameters. This listener object will listen for keyboard events.

The script starts the listener by calling `listener.start()`, which begins capturing keyboard events. The listener will run in the background while the rest of the script continues executing.

To keep the script running until the listener is stopped, the script calls `listener.join()`. This command will wait for the listener thread to complete execution before moving on.

In summary, the script captures keystrokes using the `pynput` library and stores them in a log file. It utilizes the `on_press` and `on_release` functions to handle keyboard events and updates the `current_sentence` string accordingly. The script runs indefinitely, capturing and logging keystrokes until the listener is stopped by pressing the escape key.


HOW TO OPEN THE TEXT FILE:

To open a file using a command in the Raspberry Pi terminal, you can use the `nano` command, which is a simple text editor available in most Raspberry Pi distributions. Here's how you can use it to open a file:

1. Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi.

2. Navigate to the directory where the file is located using the `cd` command. For example, if the file is in the `/home/pi/Documents` directory, you can use the following command:
   ```
   cd /home/pi/Documents
   ```

3. Once you're in the correct directory, you can open the file using the `nano` command followed by the filename. For example, if the file is named `keystrokes.log`, you can use the following command:
   ```
   nano keystrokes.log
   ```

4. The file will open in the `nano` text editor. You can navigate through the file using the arrow keys.

5. If you want to make changes to the file, you can edit the contents using the `nano` editor. Press `Ctrl+O` to save the changes and `Ctrl+X` to exit the editor.

Alternatively, you can use other text editors available in the Raspberry Pi terminal, such as `vim` or `vi`, depending on your preference and familiarity.

Remember to replace `keystrokes.log` with the actual filename of the file you want to open.

If you prefer a graphical interface to open and view the file, you can use a file manager application like `Thunar` or `PCManFM`, depending on your Raspberry Pi distribution.
